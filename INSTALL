Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``Pdfposter`` requires

* Python 2.x (tested with 2.5, but other versions should work, too),
* `pyPdf <http://pybrary.net/pyPdf/>`_ > 1.10,
* setuptools for installation (see below).


Installation on Windows-Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Installation Requirements
----------------------------

``Pdfposter`` uses setuptools for installation. Thus you need
either

  * network access, so the install script will automatically download
    and install setuptools if they are not already installed

or

  * the correct version of setuptools preinstalled using the
    `EasyInstall installation instructions`__. Those instructions also
    have tips for dealing with firewalls as well as how to manually
    download and install setuptools.

Installation 
-------------------------

Install ``pdfposter`` by just running::

   python ./setup.py install



Custom Installation Locations
------------------------------

``pdfposter`` is just a single script (aka Python program). So you can
copy it where ever you want (maybe fixing the first line). But it's
easier to just use::

   # install to /usr/local/bin
   python ./setup.py install --prefix /usr/local

   # install to your Home directory (~/bin)
   python ./setup.py install --home ~

Please mind: This effects also the installation of pyPdf (and
setuptools) if they are not already installed.

For more information about Custom Installation Locations please refer
to the `Custom Installation Locations Instructions`__ before
installing ``pdfposter``.
